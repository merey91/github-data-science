In this project, I am creating a hyphothetical scenario for a concept that there may not enough Chinese Restaurant in Toronto,Canada.Therefore it might be a great opportunity for an entrepreneur who is based in Canada. As the Chinese Food is popular among Asian community, so this entrepreneur might think of opening its business in areas where asian community resides. With the purpose in mind, finding the location to open such a restaurant is one of the most important decisions for this entrepreneur and I am designing this project to help him find the most suitable location."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<h2>Business Problem</h2>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The objective of this capstone project is to find the most suitable location for the entrepeneur to open a new Chinese restaurant in Toronto, Canada.

Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest.\n\nThe data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude of the postcodes. The information obtained per venue as follows:\n<ol>\n<li>Neighborhood</li>\n<li>Neighborhood Latitude</li>\n<li>Neighborhood Longitude</li>\n<li>Venue</li>\n<li>Name of the venue e.g. the name of a store or restaurant</li>\n<li>Venue Latitude</li>\n<li>Venue Longitude</li>\n<li>Venue Category</li>\n</ol>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<h2>Methodology</h2>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "First, I will import necessary packages and start pulling data for data prep and usage.

This is possible by exracting from wikipedia page (<a>\u201chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\u201d</a>)\n\nHowever, it is only a list of neighborhood names and postal codes. I will need to get their coordinates to utilize Foursquare to pull the list of venues near these neighborhoods. To get the coordinates, I used Geocoder package to match the coordinates of Toronto neighborhoods. After gathering all these coordinates, I visualized the map of Toronto using Folium package to verify whether these are correct coordinates.\n\nNext, I use Foursquare API to pull the list of top 100 venues within 500 meters radius. I have created a Foursquare developer account in order to obtain account ID and API key to pull the data. From Foursquare, I am able to pull the names, categories, latitude and longitude of the venues. With this data, I can also check how many unique categories that I can get from these venues. Then, I analyze each neighborhood by grouping the rows by neighborhood and taking the mean on the frequency of occurrence of each venue category. This is to prepare clustering to be done later. \n\nLastly, I performed the clustering method by using k-means clustering. K-means clustering algorithm identifies k number of centeriods, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster, while keeping the centroids as small as possible. It is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms and it is highly suited for this project as well.  Here, I looked for \u201cChinese restaurants\u201d. I have clustered the neighborhoods in Toronto into 3 clusters based on their frequency of occurrence for \u201cChinese food\u201d. Based on the results (the concentration of clusters), I will be able to recommend the ideal location to open the restaurant."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<h2>Results</h2>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<img src=\"Toronto.png\" width =\"500\" height=500 />"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The results from k-means clustering show that we can categorize Toronto neighborhoods into 3 clusters based on how many Chinese restaurants are in each neighborhood:\n<ul>\n<li>Cluster 0: Neighborhoods with high number of Chinese restaurants</li>\n<li>Cluster 1: Neighborhoods with 1 Chinese restaurant</li>\n<li>Cluster 2: Neighborhoods with little Chinese restaurants</li>\n</ul>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<h2>Recommendations</h2>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Most of Chinese restaurants are in Cluster 0 areas:\n<ol>\n<li>Garden District, Ryerson</li>    \n<li>Harbourfront East, Union Station, Toronto Islands</li>\n<li>Richmond, Adelaide, King</li>\n<li>Toronto Dominion Centre, Design Exchange</li>\n</ol>\n\nAnd the lowest (close to zero) in Cluster 1 areas which are:\n<ol>\n<li>North Toronto West, Lawrence Park areas.</li>\n</ol>\nAlso, as the competition seems to be low, there are good opportunities to open near:\n<ol>\n<li>University of Toronto, Harbord</li>\n<li>St. James Town, Cabbagetown</li>\n</ol>\nLooking at nearby venues, it seems Cluster 1 might be a good location as there are not a lot of Chinese restaurants in these areas.
