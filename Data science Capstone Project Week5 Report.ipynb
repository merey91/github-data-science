    "This is a capstone project for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. In this project, I am creating a hyphothetical scenario for a concept that there may not enough Chinese Restaurant in Toronto,Canada.Therefore it might be a great opportunity for an entrepreneur who is based in Canada. As the Chinese Food is popular among Asian community, so this entrepreneur might think of opening its business in areas where asian community resides. With the purpose in mind, finding the location to open such a restaurant is one of the most important decisions for this entrepreneur and I am designing this project to help him find the most suitable location."

    "First, I will import necessary packages and start pulling data for data prep and usage. And I need to get the list of neighborhoods in Toronto, Canada. This is possible by exracting from wikipedia page (<a>“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M”</a>)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is only a list of neighborhood names and postal codes. I will need to get their coordinates to utilize Foursquare to pull the list of venues near these neighborhoods. To get the coordinates, I used Geocoder package to match the coordinates of Toronto neighborhoods. After gathering all these coordinates, I visualized the map of Toronto using Folium package to verify whether these are correct coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I use Foursquare API to pull the list of top 100 venues within 500 meters radius. I have created a Foursquare developer account in order to obtain account ID and API key to pull the data. From Foursquare, I am able to pull the names, categories, latitude and longitude of the venues. With this data, I can also check how many unique categories that I can get from these venues. Then, I analyze each neighborhood by grouping the rows by neighborhood and taking the mean on the frequency of occurrence of each venue category. This is to prepare clustering to be done later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I performed the clustering method by using k-means clustering. K-means clustering algorithm identifies k number of centeriods, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster, while keeping the centroids as small as possible. It is one of the simplest machine learning algorithms and it is highly suited for this project as well.  Here, I looked for “Chinese restaurant”. I have clustered the neighborhoods in Toronto into 3 clusters based on their frequency of occurrence for “Chinese restaurant”. Based on the results (the concentration of clusters), I will be able to recommend the ideal location to open the restaurant."

However, for this project, it is impossible to put all these data into the project in a short time. Future research can consider these factors. In addition, I only rely on the presence of Chinese restaurants to carry out the project, but future research can consider other variables, such as the presence of Asian restaurants, the level of Asian population in each neighborhood, etc."
